**A ticker showing links crawling across the screen**

This project taught me a lot about the frustration that can come up during programming. Let's just leave it at that ðŸ˜‰

#### Features:

- A list of links is being moved across the screen with vanilla Javascript code, so that it loops
- Refactored the code to accept an argument for the direction of the movement
- Refactored the code using jQuery
- Replaced the list of links with results from the Twitter API
- Implemented the functionality to get results from multiple twitter accounts, rather than just one
- Refactored the code to obtain the results from different sources simultaniously
